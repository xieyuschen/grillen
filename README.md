# Foreword
&ensp;&ensp;Welcome to grillen, it comes from German and means `barbacue` in English. 
This project aims to generate a runnable service based on user input configuration files. 
This project is inspired by 1037 tree hollow which is in charged by me from scratch. 
As a result, I want to implement a tool help user to generate for their simple service. 
The time spent in PivotStudio has been rewarding to me and 
I want to finalize my tour in PivotStudio by this project before I go to Singapore.
